  <h1 align="center">MY LIFE EXPERIENCE</h1>
<br>
  <p>I would like to share to you about my working experience. The first time I started to work was in 2017, after I took my SPM.
My first job start at a bakery shop name Sunny Bakery, in Kuantan, Pahang. I worked there as the cashier until the SPM result was out. 
It is a shame that I do not have any picture of working there. But you can still look for the shop <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunnybakerycafe/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="blank">here</a>. </p><br>
  <img src="image/me3.jpg" width="250px" height="200px" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:15px;"><p>Next, I went to UiTM Kedah, since then I never work at all. However, during my university life, students (me), must perform internship at any information agencies. 
Internship can be consider as working too as it is a practise before the students graduate from university and start working. I went to UKM, Bangi to perform my 
internship. The internship were done for 6 weeks during our semester break, and I gain a lot from it. I choose UKM Bangi because it located near to my sister house. 
After the semester break over, so do the internship. </p>
<br>
  <p>My friends and me went back to Kedah to start our last semester. We learn just like usual until the parademic breakout. Students was asked to went back home for the 
movement control order (MCO). The higher-ups decide to perform online learning for students.</p>
<br>
  <p>MCO made the economy slowly drop down.That is why I decided to work online. Currently, I am working part time as Shaklee Intrusted Distributor (SID). Shaklee is a health beauty product for over 101 years, and the company exist for almost 62 years. 
I am still new being as a distributor, however I will try my best to help many people out there that need supplement for their health. It have
flexible working time, therefore, it will not be a problem.
